challenge 1
Fibonacci challenge
Challenge: A Fibonacci Sequence is created by adding two numbers to create the next number in the sequence. You then sum that number with the one preceding it to get the next number,, and so on. For example, if you have the sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, then the next number in the sequence is 55.

challenge 2
Missing Number Game
Challenge: Create a program that takes a series of numbers and examines it to find the numbers missing to make it a perfect range. For example, the series of numbers could be [2, 1, 5, 4, 6, 9, 7, 8, 10]. This array is missing the number 3. The goal of this problem is to write code that finds which numbers are missing, and print them out.
